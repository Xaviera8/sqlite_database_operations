# SQLite Database Operations


## This repository contains code and documentation related to a Week 3 homework assignment on Introduction to Databases with SQLite. The main objectives are to introduce databases, specifically SQLite, integrate data processing with Python, use Pandas for exploratory data analysis, and conduct database operations.
Objective

## The primary objective is to familiarize with databases, especially SQLite, and understand how to process data in Python. This involves importing datasets, exploring and analyzing the data, cleaning it, and conducting various database operations.

### Data Exploration and Analysis:
        Import pricing transparency datasets from at least two different hospital systems into a Pandas DataFrame.
        Conduct a basic exploratory analysis using Python, focusing on aspects such as data distribution, missing values, and basic statistics.
        Document any insights or observations derived from your analysis.

### SQLite Database Operations:
        Create a local SQLite database called health.db.
        Manually create a table (schema) using SQL query and populate it with fake data.
        Automatically create a table and import example data from Part 1 of the assignment using Pandas.


### Data

The data used for this assignment comprises pricing transparency datasets from two hospital systems: Stony Brook University Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital.
Submission

    Initiate a new GitHub repository titled sqlite_database_operations.
    Include Python scripts and Jupyter notebook illustrating the exploratory data analysis and database transactions.
    Add custom SQL queries and analysis (if completed).
    Provide a comprehensive README.md file with instructions to replicate the SQLite database setup and other pertinent documentation.
    Submit the URL of your public GitHub repository for evaluation.
